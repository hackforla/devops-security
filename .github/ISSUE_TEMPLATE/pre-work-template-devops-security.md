### Overview
As a new member on the HfLA devops-security team, fill in the following fields as you complete each onboarding item.

### Special Notes
1. Keep this issue open until you've completed all steps, including learning to provide updates for longer tasks.
2. Normally, handle one issue at a time, but this one is an exception as it teaches how to manage multiple tasks.
3. Work on action items sequentially, but proceed if possible. For example, set up your dev environment without waiting for the weekly meeting.

    ```bash
    # Replace USERNAME with your GitHub handle
    module "iam_user_USERNAME" {

      user_tags = {
        "Project"      = "devops-security"

      }
      user_groups = ["read-only-group"]
    }

    ```
- [ ] In your code editor navigate to `terraform` directory. `cd terraform`

Note: You must be authenticated to your AWS account via the CLI for the next commands to work. The above instructions for setting up the CLI will guide you through this process. To check to see if you are authenticated, run `aws sts get-caller-identity`. You should get a response like:

```
{
    "UserId": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU",
    "Account": "012345678910",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::012345678910:user/USERNAME"
}
```
If you are unable to authenticate from your local machine using the CLI, post in the #ops channel in Slack so that the team can help you get unblocked.
- [ ] Execute the command `terraform init` to initialize terraform in the directory. Address any failures that arise (if any).
- [ ] Execute the command `terraform plan` this will output a plan replicating the same IAM resources as the devops security account. Address any failures that arise (if any).
- [ ] Then execute the command `terraform apply` this will create all of the resources that are currently managed by Devops Security. All of the resources created here incur zero cost except for the Dynamo DB installation, which should remain in the free tier. **
  - [ ] **If you have cost concerns, Run a Terraform Destroy to take down all of the resources you created (don't worry, you can recreate them just as quickly). If you create resources outside of what's described in this issue, you may incur charges.**
- [ ] Update the README using Terraform Docs to document changes
  - [ ] ```terraform-docs -c .terraform.docs.yml .```
- [ ] Once you have tested your changes, stage them in git with 
    - [ ] `git status` command.
    - [ ] then `git add path/to/file` (you can copy from above output for the file path).
- [ ] Commit the changes by executing `git commit -m "brief description of changes"`.
- [ ] Push the changes with `git push --set-upstream origin name-of-branch`
